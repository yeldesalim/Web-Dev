<!-- Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div> -->
<!-- The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document. -->

    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

<!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
The <div> element is a block-level element and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document -->
